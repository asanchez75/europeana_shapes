### About the Dataset

This [Dataset]
(/shapes-edm/src/test/resources/etc/edm/datasets/data/DBpediaConcepts.xml) 
is the complete set (composed of 280 resources) of a selective harvest from 
[DBPedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org) containing only resources of type skos:Concept 
and which is currently being used as the target of [Semantic Enrichment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JvjrWMTpMIH7WnuieNqcT0zpJAXUPo6x4uMBj1pEx0Y) 
at Europeana.

### Validaton Report

The table below shows an overview of the constraint violations that were 
identified when applying the [EDM shape definitions](../shapes) using 
[TopBraid SHACL](http://github.com/TopQuadrant/shacl) validator. 
The results are grouped first by the type of resource and then by violating 
constraint. The complete list of results is stored in this 
[file](/shapes-edm/src/test/resources/etc/edm/datasets/results/DBpediaConcepts.xml).
