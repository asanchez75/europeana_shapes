# EDM Shapes Definitions

This project details an effort to represent validation constraints that are 
currenly defined in the [EDM schema](http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/), 
but also constraints that had previously been identified in previous Europeana 
projects and the new requirements identified within the 
[Data Quality Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOSKrX7X9oU7Ob3wjinXVWenx8HCq5qnhUzljcpFKs8), 
using the [W3C SHACL Constraint Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).
